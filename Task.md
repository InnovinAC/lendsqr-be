# Assessment

Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.

You are required to build an MVP (Minimum viable product)  wallet service where:

- A user can create an account
- A user can fund their account
- A user can transfer funds to another user’s account
- A user can withdraw funds from their account.
- A user with records in the Lendsqr Adjutor [Karma blacklist](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://api.adjutor.io\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1751151409333102\&usg=AOvVaw34uoEugcjfxcYpumWVIWBq) should never be onboarded


# Your task is to present  

- A  readme design document for your implementation
- An implementation of the project (NodeJS API using TypeScript)
- You may not bother about building a full authentication system, a faux token based authentication will suffice.
- Ensure to write unit tests for the project
- You would be required to sign up to the Lendsqr Adjutor API service in order to use the Karma blacklist functionality
